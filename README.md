# sipri
A simple way to access Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's (SIPRI) trade register API and return a CSV file.

```
>>>import sipri
>>> data = sipri.sipri_data()
>>> data

Sipri_data allows you to quickly pull from SIPRI's API and return a comma seperated string for easy transfer to a CSV or pandas dataframe. The sipri package is safe and only uses requests as an external package.

_Couldn't I have just done this myself?_
* Absolutly, there is nothing special about this package. Normaly when you access SIPRI's trade registar the data is returened in a rich text file (rtf). Parsing a rtf is not a great experience. When I was searching for a way to get the data in some other way, I found there were lots of other people asking the same quesiton. So, I decided to make this package in hopes of helping future analysts. Plus, I've never made a python package before so I thought this would be an easy one to start with.

## Getting Started

Sipri is available on PyPI:

```$ python -m pip install sipri```

Sipri only supports Python 3.5+, but probably will work on Python 2.7 as well.

## Keyword Arguments

```sipri.sipri_data(low_year='2020',high_year='2020',seller='',buyer='',armanent_category='any',buyers_or_sellers='',filetype='csv',include_open_deals='on',sum_deliveries='off')```

* low_year:(optional) This is the year you want the query to start with (defaults to '2020').<br>
* high_year:(optional) This is the year you want the query to end with (defaults to '2020').<br>
* seller: (optional) The entity/country selling equipment (defaults to all entity/country) see the entity/country list below for all possible three letter values and corresponding name.<br>
* buyer: (optional) The entity/country buying equipment (defaults to all entity/country) see the entity/country list below for all possible three letter values and corresponding name.<br>
* armanent_category: (optional) The specific equipment category tracked by SIPRI (defaults to 'any'). Equipment category list is provided below.<br>
* buyers_or_sellers: (optional) Sorts the data by sellers or buyers (this is important if you choose 'rtf' as a file type).<br>
* filetype: (optional) accepted values are 'csv'(default value) or 'rtf'.
* include_open_deals: (optional) accepted values are 'on'(default value) or 'off'.<br>
* sum_deliveries: (optional) accepted values are 'on' or 'off'(default value) this will sum all deliveries if 'on' is selected.<br>

## Examples

Pulling data and importing into a Pandas dataframe.
```
>>> import sipri
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> import io
>>> from io import StringIO

>>> data = sipri.sipri_data()
>>> df = pd.read_csv(StringIO(data),keep_default_na=False,na_values=['None'])

>>> df.head()

<the first five rows of the pandas data frame will return>
```

Only looking for aircraft sold by the UK during the year 1995.
```
